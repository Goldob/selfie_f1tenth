## Workspace setup

In order to build this project, you need to have a [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) setup in a convenient location. It will be further assumed that the workspace is configured at `~/catkin_ws`, but any other place will be fine, provided write permissions. When evaluating the shell commands below, change the location if necessary.

The repository should be placed in the [source space](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Source_Space) of your workspace. It can be done as follows.

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Goldob/selfie_f1tenth
```


### Building packages

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
source ./devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
catkin_make install
```
